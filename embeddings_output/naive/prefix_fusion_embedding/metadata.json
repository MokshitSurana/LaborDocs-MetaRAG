Side Letter on Teaching Professor Ranks\nIn accordance with the University Senate resolution passed on April 21, 2022, \u201cas the \u2018Teaching\u2019\nmodifier is implemented, in no case will an individual who is currently in a position modified by\nthe \u2018Clinical\u2019 or the \u2018Research\u2019 modifier be required to convert to one modified by the \u2018Teaching\u2019\nmodifier\u201d as a condition for reappointment. As the implementation of the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier will\ninvolve a historic restructuring of faculty positions in many academic units, these units, their unit\nexecutive officers, and their committees will make every reasonable effort to facilitate appropriate\nappointment changes and promotions, while maintaining the original or current workload,\nevaluation criteria, and promotion norms for those bargaining unit members who do not elect to\npursue appointment change to positions bearing the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier. Academic units that elect to adopt the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier for non-tenured academic ranks of\nassistant professor, associate professor, and professor shall review and revise their written\nworkload expectations, Annual Evaluation criteria, and Promotion Norms and Expectations to\ndistinguish faculty job responsibilities and expectations as necessary across all non- tenured\nacademic ranks used in these units.
