To be considered, a grievance must\nallege a breach of a specific term of this Agreement, be in written form, signed by the\nresident(s) or representative and filed with the resident\u2019s department. The written grievance must contain: the date of the violation, a specific description of\nthe dispute, the facts of the case, the section(s) of the Agreement alleged to have been\nviolated, and the relief sought.",

Side Letter on Teaching Professor Ranks\nIn accordance with the University Senate resolution passed on April 21, 2022, \u201cas the \u2018Teaching\u2019\nmodifier is implemented, in no case will an individual who is currently in a position modified by\nthe \u2018Clinical\u2019 or the \u2018Research\u2019 modifier be required to convert to one modified by the \u2018Teaching\u2019\nmodifier\u201d as a condition for reappointment. As the implementation of the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier will\ninvolve a historic restructuring of faculty positions in many academic units, these units, their unit\nexecutive officers, and their committees will make every reasonable effort to facilitate appropriate\nappointment changes and promotions, while maintaining the original or current workload,\nevaluation criteria, and promotion norms for those bargaining unit members who do not elect to\npursue appointment change to positions bearing the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier. Academic units that elect to adopt the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier for non-tenured academic ranks of\nassistant professor, associate professor, and professor shall review and revise their written\nworkload expectations, Annual Evaluation criteria, and Promotion Norms and Expectations to\ndistinguish faculty job responsibilities and expectations as necessary across all non- tenured\nacademic ranks used in these units. This review and revision process shall be completed within a\nyear of signing this Agreement. Individual units may elect to apply for position changes for bargaining unit members to the\nappropriate Teaching professor rank. If the unit determines that the bargaining unit member (1)\n33 of 35\n\nwill perform the job responsibilities of a position bearing the newly adopted \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier,\n(2) wishes to be considered for the appropriate Teaching professor rank, and (3) possesses the\ndegree required by the University for that rank, the unit shall submit a position change request to\nthe appropriate University office, along with the necessary justification and supporting materials to\ndocument the change for that bargaining unit member. The University recognizes that the terminal\ndegree may not be the doctorate in certain cases. The unit shall have the discretion to decide\nwhether to apply for appointment changes for bargaining unit members who wish to be considered\nfor the appropriate Teaching professor rank.",
