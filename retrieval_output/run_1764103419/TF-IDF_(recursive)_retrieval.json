The appointment level (full time equivalency or FTE) shall be based on the\nappointing department\u2019s determination of the amount of time it should normally take to\nperform the assigned duties including orientation and training.

Assistants appointed for other FTE levels would be expected to\nperform work for a proportionately greater or lesser average number of hours per week.\nThe actual number of weekly hours of work are expected to vary over the course of the\nappointment term.\nB. It is understood that assistants in the bargaining unit are engaged in professional\nactivities of such a nature that the output produced, or the result accomplished, cannot be\nprecisely standardized or measured in relation to a given period of time, and that the time\nnecessary to accomplish an assignment may vary.\nC. An assistant may object to a workload that causes their hours of work to exceed the\nhours expected for the FTE of their appointment, as provided above, if the assistant\nreasonably believes that their duties require hours that exceed the hours of effort required\nby the appointment percentage or constitute an arbitrary or capricious workload. The\nassistant must raise the matter with their department supervisor. Following the meeting\nwith the assistant, if the department supervisor concludes that the assistant is working\nexcessive hours based on their assigned FTE, the supervisor shall recommend: (1) that\nthe assistant conform to the hours normally needed by assistants with similar duties; (2)\nthat certain duties be reduced and/or reassigned to others; (3) that the assistant\u2019s FTE be\nincreased; or (4) that the assistant be reassigned with consultation to a different position\nwith equivalent appointment terms. Should the appropriate department supervisor fail to\nresolve the issue of excessive hours of work to the mutual satisfaction of both parties, the\nassistant shall have the option of pursuing the matter through the Grievance Procedure in\naccordance with Article XXII of this Agreement.\nD. Employment and course assignments shall be offered to the assistant in a timely\nfashion and as quickly as practically possible, to allow for adequate preparation. If course\nassignments offered in writing are subsequently changed, the hours spent in preparation\nfor the original assignment shall be credited for the purpose of determining workload.\nWhen there is a pattern of late assignment changes in a department less than five (5)\nbusiness days before the start of classes, a meeting shall be held for purposes of\naddressing the reason. These meetings shall include the Department Head or designee\nand a representative from the Union. Course assignments shall not be made in a\ncapricious manner.\n13",

The University will not negotiate terms and\nconditions of employment regarding residents, as defined by law, without their Union\nrepresentative present. This procedure, if followed in good faith by both parties, should\nlead to a fair and prompt solution to most of the University/resident problems.\nStep One\nRegardless of whether a grievable matter is sought to be resolved through informal\ndiscussion, a resident who alleges the University has breached a specific term of this\nAgreement shall have twenty-eight (28) calendar days to file a grievance, calculated\nfrom the date of the occurrence leading to the grievance or twenty-eight (28) calendar\ndays after the resident or Union should reasonably have known of the occurrence\nleading to the grievance, whichever is earlier. To be considered, a grievance must\nallege a breach of a specific term of this Agreement, be in written form, signed by the\nresident(s) or representative and filed with the resident\u2019s department.\nThe written grievance must contain: the date of the violation, a specific description of\nthe dispute, the facts of the case, the section(s) of the Agreement alleged to have been\nviolated, and the relief sought. The department will give a written decision on the\ngrievance within twenty-eight (28) calendar days after receipt of the grievance or within\ntwenty-eight (28) calendar days of a meeting, if the department chooses to hold one,\nwhichever is later.\nStep Two\nIn the event the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the decision may be appealed in\nwriting to the designated representative of the College of Medicine. The appeal must be\nfiled within fourteen (14) calendar days after the Step 1 decision is received or due,\nwhichever occurs first. Any decision at Step 1 that is not appealed within fourteen (14)\ncalendar days after it is received or due shall be considered binding and is not\nappealable. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Chancellor (or designee) will offer a hearing\nto the grievant, conduct any investigation that is deemed necessary, and issue a written\ndecision on the grievance within twenty-eight (28) calendar days after hearing of the\nappeal.\n19",

Assistants\u2019 hours of work are reflected in their percentage of appointment. Such hours\nof work are separate and distinct from the time required for an assistant\u2019s own academic\ncoursework. The appointment level (full time equivalency or FTE) shall be based on the\nappointing department\u2019s determination of the amount of time it should normally take to\nperform the assigned duties including orientation and training. It is expected that a .5 FTE\nassistant will devote an average of 20 hours per week over the course of a full\nappointment period. Assistants appointed for other FTE levels would be expected to\nperform work for a proportionately greater or lesser average number of hours per week.\nThe actual number of weekly hours of work are expected to vary over the course of the\nappointment term.\nB. It is understood that assistants in the bargaining unit are engaged in professional\nactivities of such a nature that the output produced, or the result accomplished, cannot be\nprecisely standardized or measured in relation to a given period of time, and that the time\nnecessary to accomplish an assignment may vary.\nC. An assistant may object to a workload that causes their hours of work to exceed the\nhours expected for the FTE of their appointment, as provided above, if the assistant\nreasonably believes that their duties require hours that exceed the hours of effort required\nby the appointment percentage or constitute an arbitrary or capricious workload. The\nassistant must raise the matter with their department supervisor. Following the meeting\nwith the assistant, if the department supervisor concludes that the assistant is working\nexcessive hours based on their assigned FTE, the supervisor shall recommend: (1) that\nthe assistant conform to the hours normally needed by assistants with similar duties; (2)\nthat certain duties be reduced and/or reassigned to others; (3) that the assistant\u2019s FTE be\nincreased; or (4) that the assistant be reassigned with consultation to a different position\nwith equivalent appointment terms. Should the appropriate department supervisor fail to\nresolve the issue of excessive hours of work to the mutual satisfaction of both parties, the\nassistant shall have the option of pursuing the matter through the Grievance Procedure in\naccordance with Article XXII of this Agreement.\nD. Employment and course assignments shall be offered to the assistant in a timely\nfashion and as quickly as practically possible, to allow for adequate preparation. If course\nassignments offered in writing are subsequently changed, the hours spent in preparation\nfor the original assignment shall be credited for the purpose of determining workload.\nWhen there is a pattern of late assignment changes in a department less than five (5)\nbusiness days before the start of classes, a meeting shall be held for purposes of\naddressing the reason. These meetings shall include the Department Head or designee\nand a representative from the Union. Course assignments shall not be made in a\ncapricious manner.\n13",

The University agrees not to negotiate with any other labor organization, its agent,\nany employee organization, or campus organization over wages, hours and terms and\nconditions of employment for the employees within the bargaining unit. This Agreement\nshall not be construed to prevent the University or any administrator or faculty or staff\nmember from meeting with any University organization or group, including student\norganizations, to hear their views on any matters.\nIII. Appointment Terms\nA. Eligibility for Assistant Appointments\nTo be eligible for an assistant appointment, a TA or GA must be enrolled as a student and\nin good academic standing in a graduate program at UIC and meet other applicable\nrequirements. For summer assistantships, assistants are not required to be registered\nduring the summer if they were registered for the immediately preceding semester or are\nregistered for the fall semester. If an individual who has accepted a TA or GA\nappointment fails to enroll, withdraws or otherwise fails to maintain academic eligibility\nin a graduate program, the University may, at its sole discretion and not subject to appeal\nunder the Grievance Procedure, cancel the assistantship appointment. Only degree-\nseeking students may be eligible for an assistantship. Assistants who are determined to be\nineligible for an assistantship appointment after the start date of their appointment shall\nbe paid in full for all work performed on a pro-rata basis unless such ineligibility is based\non an international student\u2019s legal visa status barring employment.\nB. Required Documentation\nAll appointments are contingent upon the applicant\u2019s compliance with documentation\nrequirements for employment. Currently these requirements include (for applicants who\nhave never held an assistantship or other appointment at the University or have not held\nan appointment in the last 90 days) completion of the I-9 and employee information\nforms as soon as possible, and in every case, before the assistant performs any services\nassociated with the appointment.\n2",

This procedure, if followed in good faith by both parties, should\nlead to a fair and prompt solution to most of the University/resident problems.\nStep One\nRegardless of whether a grievable matter is sought to be resolved through informal\ndiscussion, a resident who alleges the University has breached a specific term of this\nAgreement shall have twenty-eight (28) calendar days to file a grievance, calculated\nfrom the date of the occurrence leading to the grievance or twenty-eight (28) calendar\ndays after the resident or Union should reasonably have known of the occurrence\nleading to the grievance, whichever is earlier. To be considered, a grievance must\nallege a breach of a specific term of this Agreement, be in written form, signed by the\nresident(s) or representative and filed with the resident\u2019s department.\nThe written grievance must contain: the date of the violation, a specific description of\nthe dispute, the facts of the case, the section(s) of the Agreement alleged to have been\nviolated, and the relief sought. The department will give a written decision on the\ngrievance within twenty-eight (28) calendar days after receipt of the grievance or within\ntwenty-eight (28) calendar days of a meeting, if the department chooses to hold one,\nwhichever is later.\nStep Two\nIn the event the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the decision may be appealed in\nwriting to the designated representative of the College of Medicine. The appeal must be\nfiled within fourteen (14) calendar days after the Step 1 decision is received or due,\nwhichever occurs first. Any decision at Step 1 that is not appealed within fourteen (14)\ncalendar days after it is received or due shall be considered binding and is not\nappealable. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Chancellor (or designee) will offer a hearing\nto the grievant, conduct any investigation that is deemed necessary, and issue a written\ndecision on the grievance within twenty-eight (28) calendar days after hearing of the\nappeal.\n19",

No officer or representative of the Union shall authorize, institute, instigate, aid or\ncondone any such activities by members of the bargaining unit. The Union further agrees that it\nwill take reasonable means which are within its power to induce employees engaged in a strike\nor work stoppage in violation of the terms of this Agreement to return to work; such reasonable\nmeans include the Union, through its officials, disavowing in writing any such action or\ninterference and advising in writing that faculty engaged in such activity immediately return to\nwork and cease the violation. Faculty who violate this Article may be subject to disciplinary\naction under the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of this \u201cno strike pledge\u201d, no lockout\nof employees shall be instituted by the Employer during the term of this Agreement; provided,\nhowever, this Article should not be construed as requiring the University to stay in continuous\noperation.\nArticle XX.

The\nUniversity shall maintain this Agreement on its website for the duration of the Agreement.\nArticle XXI.

If either Party makes a request, the\ninvalidated part(s) or provision(s) will be renegotiated.\nArticle XXII. Entire Agreement\nThe Parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each\nhad the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any\nsubject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and that the\nunderstandings and agreements arrived at by the Parties after the exercise of that right and\nopportunity are set forth in this Agreement.\nThis Agreement represents the entire agreement between the University and the Union, and no\nfurther decisional bargaining is required during the term of the Agreement over mandatory or\npermissive subjects or practices not expressly addressed in this Agreement.

The appointment level (full time equivalency or FTE) shall be based on the\nappointing department\u2019s determination of the amount of time it should normally take to\nperform the assigned duties including orientation and training. It is expected that a .5 FTE\nassistant will devote an average of 20 hours per week over the course of a full\nappointment period. Assistants appointed for other FTE levels would be expected to\nperform work for a proportionately greater or lesser average number of hours per week.\nThe actual number of weekly hours of work are expected to vary over the course of the\nappointment term.\nB. It is understood that assistants in the bargaining unit are engaged in professional\nactivities of such a nature that the output produced, or the result accomplished, cannot be\nprecisely standardized or measured in relation to a given period of time, and that the time\nnecessary to accomplish an assignment may vary.\nC. An assistant may object to a workload that causes their hours of work to exceed the\nhours expected for the FTE of their appointment, as provided above, if the assistant\nreasonably believes that their duties require hours that exceed the hours of effort required\nby the appointment percentage or constitute an arbitrary or capricious workload. The\nassistant must raise the matter with their department supervisor. Following the meeting\nwith the assistant, if the department supervisor concludes that the assistant is working\nexcessive hours based on their assigned FTE, the supervisor shall recommend: (1) that\nthe assistant conform to the hours normally needed by assistants with similar duties; (2)\nthat certain duties be reduced and/or reassigned to others; (3) that the assistant\u2019s FTE be\nincreased; or (4) that the assistant be reassigned with consultation to a different position\nwith equivalent appointment terms. Should the appropriate department supervisor fail to\nresolve the issue of excessive hours of work to the mutual satisfaction of both parties, the\nassistant shall have the option of pursuing the matter through the Grievance Procedure in\naccordance with Article XXII of this Agreement.\nD. Employment and course assignments shall be offered to the assistant in a timely\nfashion and as quickly as practically possible, to allow for adequate preparation. If course\nassignments offered in writing are subsequently changed, the hours spent in preparation\nfor the original assignment shall be credited for the purpose of determining workload.\nWhen there is a pattern of late assignment changes in a department less than five (5)\nbusiness days before the start of classes, a meeting shall be held for purposes of\naddressing the reason.

A faculty member should be mindful, however, that\naccuracy, forthrightness, and dignity befit association with the University and a person of\nlearning, and that the public may judge that person\u2019s profession and the University by the\nindividual\u2019s conduct and utterances.\nC. A faculty member who believes that they do not enjoy the academic freedom which is the\npolicy of the University to maintain and encourage shall be entitled to a hearing on\nwritten request before the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure of the campus\nSenate. Such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with established rules of\nprocedure. The Committee shall make findings of facts and recommendations to the\nPresident and, at its discretion, may make an appropriate report to the Senate. The several\ncommittees may from time to time establish their own rules of procedure.\nD. Any substantive dispute under this Article shall be resolved under Article X, Section 2\n(d), of the University of Illinois Statutes.\nE. Any procedural dispute under this Article under the control of a Party to this Agreement\nshall be resolved under the Grievance and Arbitration procedure in this Agreement, and\nany such grievance decision thereunder shall be limited to providing a remedy correcting a\nprocess error.\nArticle XI. Governance\nA. The Union retains the exclusive right to negotiate and reach agreement on wages, hours, and\nterms and conditions of employment for the members of the bargaining unit. The Parties to this\nAgreement recognize and support the role of the UIC Senate as established by the University\nof Illinois Statutes such as its general responsibilities in areas including but not limited to: (a)\ncurriculum policy and curricular structure; (b) requirements for degrees and granting of\ndegrees; (c) policies for recruitment, admission and retention of students; (d) academic policies\nrelating to students; (e) reviewing and proposing changes to the Statutes; and (f) academic\nfreedom. The above list of Senate responsibilities is not inclusive of the Senate\u2019s full role as\nprovided in the University of Illinois Statutes and is not intended to expand or limit that role.\nB. Once a semester at the Union\u2019s request, the Union will meet with the Chancellor, the Vice\nChancellor for Health Affairs, Chancellor and/or Provost. Fourteen (14) days prior to such\n21 of 35",

Except in the case of an assistant professor who is in the first year of\nacademic service at this University, (a) written notice of non-reappointment shall be\ngiven not less than twelve months before the expiration of the appointment; or (b) if\ngiven less than twelve months before the expiration of the appointment, written notice\nof non-reappointment shall be accompanied by an offer from the Board of Trustees of a\nterminal contract for one additional year of academic service. In the case of an assistant\nprofessor on a definite-term appointment who is in the first year of academic service at\nthis University, written notice of non-reappointment shall be given not later than March\n1 and need not be accompanied by an offer of a terminal contract; if written notice of\nnon-reappointment is given after March 1, it shall be accompanied by an offer from the\nBoard of Trustees of a terminal contract for one additional year of service. Such non-\nreappointment is not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of this\nagreement.\nC. Promotion and Tenure\n1. Only the Board of Trustees may promote or award tenure to tenure track faculty.\nTenure track faculty members attain promotion and tenure in accordance with\nUniversity of Illinois Statutes, The General Rules Concerning University Organization\nand related UIC campus policies such as promotion and tenure guidelines, as those\ndocuments may be amended.\n2. Each administration representative who is directly involved in making decisions\nregarding promotion and/or tenure of tenure track faculty is encouraged to make a\nseparate and independent evaluation of the candidate and their credentials.\n3. Decisions of the University relating to appointment, reappointment, promotion and\ntenure will be made consistent with the University of Illinois Statutes, The General\nRules Concerning University Organization, and related UIC campus policies, as those\n17 of 30",
