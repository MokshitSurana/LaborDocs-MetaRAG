Side Letter on Teaching Professor Ranks\nIn accordance with the University Senate resolution passed on April 21, 2022, \u201cas the \u2018Teaching\u2019\nmodifier is implemented, in no case will an individual who is currently in a position modified by\nthe \u2018Clinical\u2019 or the \u2018Research\u2019 modifier be required to convert to one modified by the \u2018Teaching\u2019\nmodifier\u201d as a condition for reappointment. As the implementation of the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier will\ninvolve a historic restructuring of faculty positions in many academic units, these units, their unit\nexecutive officers, and their committees will make every reasonable effort to facilitate appropriate\nappointment changes and promotions, while maintaining the original or current workload,\nevaluation criteria, and promotion norms for those bargaining unit members who do not elect to\npursue appointment change to positions bearing the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier.

Side Letter on Teaching Professor Ranks\nIn accordance with the University Senate resolution passed on April 21, 2022, \u201cas the \u2018Teaching\u2019\nmodifier is implemented, in no case will an individual who is currently in a position modified by\nthe \u2018Clinical\u2019 or the \u2018Research\u2019 modifier be required to convert to one modified by the \u2018Teaching\u2019\nmodifier\u201d as a condition for reappointment. As the implementation of the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier will\ninvolve a historic restructuring of faculty positions in many academic units, these units, their unit\nexecutive officers, and their committees will make every reasonable effort to facilitate appropriate\nappointment changes and promotions, while maintaining the original or current workload,\nevaluation criteria, and promotion norms for those bargaining unit members who do not elect to\npursue appointment change to positions bearing the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier. Academic units that elect to adopt the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier for non-tenured academic ranks of\nassistant professor, associate professor, and professor shall review and revise their written\nworkload expectations, Annual Evaluation criteria, and Promotion Norms and Expectations to\ndistinguish faculty job responsibilities and expectations as necessary across all non- tenured\nacademic ranks used in these units. This review and revision process shall be completed within a\nyear of signing this Agreement. Individual units may elect to apply for position changes for bargaining unit members to the\nappropriate Teaching professor rank. If the unit determines that the bargaining unit member (1)\n33 of 35\n\nwill perform the job responsibilities of a position bearing the newly adopted \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier,\n(2) wishes to be considered for the appropriate Teaching professor rank, and (3) possesses the\ndegree required by the University for that rank, the unit shall submit a position change request to\nthe appropriate University office, along with the necessary justification and supporting materials to\ndocument the change for that bargaining unit member. The University recognizes that the terminal\ndegree may not be the doctorate in certain cases. The unit shall have the discretion to decide\nwhether to apply for appointment changes for bargaining unit members who wish to be considered\nfor the appropriate Teaching professor rank.",

The\npurpose of the annual evaluation is to recognize and record the accomplishments of\neach member and to make judgments regarding the significance of these\naccomplishments, which judgments shall form part of the basis for assigning salary\nincreases and recommending promotion.\u201d\n2. Written expectations for faculty as defined in Article XII of this Agreement shall\nprovide part of the basis for the Annual Evaluation criteria for bargaining unit members. The University and UICUF recognize that quality and effectiveness in the categories of\nwork listed in Article XII, Sections D.1-D.4 of this Agreement are the essence of\nprofessional work in academia, and quality and effectiveness in these categories are\ncentral elements of the Annual Evaluation process. Student evaluation data shall not be considered in isolation to make decisions related to\nthe renewal of employment, promotion cases, or the determination of merit raises. 20 of 35\n\nArticle X.

Upon\ntermination of this Agreement, all benefits and obligations hereunder shall be terminated and shall\nnot survive the Agreement unless otherwise required by law. Side Letter on Teaching Professor Ranks\nIn accordance with the University Senate resolution passed on April 21, 2022, \u201cas the \u2018Teaching\u2019\nmodifier is implemented, in no case will an individual who is currently in a position modified by\nthe \u2018Clinical\u2019 or the \u2018Research\u2019 modifier be required to convert to one modified by the \u2018Teaching\u2019\nmodifier\u201d as a condition for reappointment. As the implementation of the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier will\ninvolve a historic restructuring of faculty positions in many academic units, these units, their unit\nexecutive officers, and their committees will make every reasonable effort to facilitate appropriate\nappointment changes and promotions, while maintaining the original or current workload,\nevaluation criteria, and promotion norms for those bargaining unit members who do not elect to\npursue appointment change to positions bearing the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier. Academic units that elect to adopt the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier for non-tenured academic ranks of\nassistant professor, associate professor, and professor shall review and revise their written\nworkload expectations, Annual Evaluation criteria, and Promotion Norms and Expectations to\ndistinguish faculty job responsibilities and expectations as necessary across all non- tenured\nacademic ranks used in these units. This review and revision process shall be completed within a\nyear of signing this Agreement. Individual units may elect to apply for position changes for bargaining unit members to the\nappropriate Teaching professor rank. If the unit determines that the bargaining unit member (1)\n33 of 35\n\nwill perform the job responsibilities of a position bearing the newly adopted \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier,\n(2) wishes to be considered for the appropriate Teaching professor rank, and (3) possesses the\ndegree required by the University for that rank, the unit shall submit a position change request to\nthe appropriate University office, along with the necessary justification and supporting materials to\ndocument the change for that bargaining unit member. The University recognizes that the terminal\ndegree may not be the doctorate in certain cases. The unit shall have the discretion to decide\nwhether to apply for appointment changes for bargaining unit members who wish to be considered\nfor the appropriate Teaching professor rank.",

Side Letter on Teaching Professor Ranks\nIn accordance with the University Senate resolution passed on April 21, 2022, \u201cas the \u2018Teaching\u2019\nmodifier is implemented, in no case will an individual who is currently in a position modified by\nthe \u2018Clinical\u2019 or the \u2018Research\u2019 modifier be required to convert to one modified by the \u2018Teaching\u2019\nmodifier\u201d as a condition for reappointment. As the implementation of the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier will\ninvolve a historic restructuring of faculty positions in many academic units, these units, their unit\nexecutive officers, and their committees will make every reasonable effort to facilitate appropriate\nappointment changes and promotions, while maintaining the original or current workload,\nevaluation criteria, and promotion norms for those bargaining unit members who do not elect to\npursue appointment change to positions bearing the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier. Academic units that elect to adopt the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier for non-tenured academic ranks of\nassistant professor, associate professor, and professor shall review and revise their written\nworkload expectations, Annual Evaluation criteria, and Promotion Norms and Expectations to\ndistinguish faculty job responsibilities and expectations as necessary across all non- tenured\nacademic ranks used in these units.
