To be considered, a grievance must\nallege a breach of a specific term of this Agreement, be in written form, signed by the\nresident(s) or representative and filed with the resident\u2019s department. The written grievance must contain: the date of the violation, a specific description of\nthe dispute, the facts of the case, the section(s) of the Agreement alleged to have been\nviolated, and the relief sought.",
