Only the Board of Trustees may promote or award tenure to tenure track faculty [Source 7].\n\n*   **Non-Reappointment Notice for Assistant Professors:** Assistant professors on a definite-term appointment must receive written notice of non-reappointment. If in their first year of academic service, the notice must be given by March 1 and doesn't require a terminal contract offer. If given after March 1, a terminal contract for one additional year of service must be offered by the Board of Trustees [Source 7, 8]. For assistant professors not in their first year, notice must be given at least twelve months before the appointment expires, or a terminal contract for one additional year of academic service must be offered [Source 8].\n\n*   **For Bargaining Unit Faculty (Non-Tenure Track):** Procedures for reappointment of bargaining unit faculty are outlined in the bylaws of the faculty member\u2019s academic unit. If not included in the bylaws, academic units should develop and incorporate reappointment procedures within one year of the agreement signing [Source 10]. Faculty continuously employed for at least ten years receive notice of reappointment or non-reappointment one year before their contracts end [Source 5]. Faculty employed for less than ten years are to be informed of reappointment or non-reappointment by May 15 each year [Source 10].\n\n*   **University Rights:** The University retains the right to determine whether faculty will be reappointed and the terms and conditions governing such reappointment [Source 2, 3].
