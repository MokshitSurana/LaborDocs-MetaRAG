      "answer": "Assistants\u2019 hours of work are reflected in their percentage of appointment [Source 5]. The appointment level (full time equivalency or FTE) shall be based on the appointing department\u2019s determination of the amount of time it should normally take to perform the assigned duties including orientation and training [Source 5]. It is expected that a .5 FTE assistant will devote an average of 20 hours per week over the course of a full appointment period [Source 5]. Assistants appointed for other FTE levels would be expected to perform work for a proportionately greater or lesser average number of hours per week [Source 5].",

It aims to protect bargaining unit members from influences that would restrict the exercise of these freedoms in their scholarly areas [Source 7]. Faculty members can exercise the same freedoms as other citizens but should be mindful of their association with the University. A faculty member who believes their academic freedom has been violated is entitled to a hearing before the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure of the campus Senate [Source 7].\n*   **TT Faculty:** There is an \"Article X. Academic Freedom\" listed in the contract provisions [Source 2].\n*   **GEO:** The University and the Union agree that academic freedom is essential to higher education [Source 3]. The University retains control over academic judgments concerning courses, curriculum, instruction, content of courses, methods of instruction, instructional materials, the nature and form of assignments, class size, and grading policies [Source 3].
