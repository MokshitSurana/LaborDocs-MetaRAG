      "answer": "The grievance procedure for assistants under the GEO collective bargaining agreement involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Informal Resolution:** An effort should first be made to adjust an alleged grievance informally between the assistant (and their Union representative, if so desired) and the immediate supervisor [Source 3]. A request may be made for a time extension to continue efforts towards reaching an informal resolution [Source 3].\n2.  **Filing a Grievance:** If a resolution is not reached informally, a grievance must be filed within thirty (30) business days from the date when the first events or pattern of events on which the grievance is based should reasonably have been discovered [Source 3]. Failure to file within this time constitutes a waiver of the grievance [Source 3].\n3.  **Union Grievances:** The Union may file a grievance at Level 3 if the grievance affects more than one assistant and/or is common to assistants employed in more than one department or if the grievance is of an issue whereby the supervisor and/or Unit Executive Officer (UEO) do not have authority to resolve the grievance, or in a case involving dismissal of an assistant during the appointment period [Source 3].\n4.  **Time Limits:** Failure to appeal a grievance from one level to another within the time periods provided constitutes a waiver of the grievance [Source 3]. Written requests by either party for an extension of any and all time limits shall not be unreasonably denied [Source 3].\n5.  **Arbitration:** The Union may submit a grievance to arbitration within twenty (20) business days following receipt of the decision at Level 3 [Source 5].\n\nThe agreement also includes the following general provisions:\n\n*   An assistant who participates in the grievance procedure shall not be subject to discipline or reprisal because of such participation [Source 3].\n*   Meetings, conferences, and hearings under this procedure shall be conducted at a time and place that will afford a fair and reasonable opportunity for necessary persons, including witnesses, to attend [Source 3].\n*   All records of grievances will be kept separate from the official personnel file maintained by the University\u2019s Human Resource Office(s) [Source 3].\n*   The phrase \u201cbusiness days\u201d for purposes of this Article shall mean Monday through Friday, excluding campus-designated holidays [Source 3].",

The supervisor shall meet with the grievant (and up to two (2) Union representatives, if so desired by the grievant) and shall give a written decision on the grievance to the grievant within fourteen (14) business days [Source 7].\n*   **Level 2:** If not resolved in Level 1, the decision may be appealed to the Dean of the College in writing within twenty-five (25) business days after receipt of the decision in Level 1 [Source 9].

The Parties shall promptly notify the arbitrator of their selection [Source 8, Source 9].\n*   **Hearing:** The grievance shall be heard by a single arbitrator, and both Parties may be represented by such persons as they may designate [Source 8, Source 9]. Both Parties have the right to a hearing to submit evidence, offer testimony, and make oral or written arguments [Source 8, Source 9].\n*   **Decision:** The arbitrator must issue their decision in writing not later than twenty-five (25) business days from the date of the close of the hearings or from the date the final statements and proofs on the issues are submitted to them [Source 8, Source 9]. The arbitrator\u2019s decision shall be in writing and shall set forth their findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusions on the issues submitted [Source 8, Source 9].\n*   The arbitrator\u2019s authority is limited to determining whether the University has violated arbitrable provisions of this contract [Source 6, Source 8].
