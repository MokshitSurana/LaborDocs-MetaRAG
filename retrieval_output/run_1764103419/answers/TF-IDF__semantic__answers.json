The purpose of the annual evaluation is to recognize and record accomplishments and to make judgments regarding the significance of these accomplishments, which will form part of the basis for assigning salary increases and recommending promotion [Source 9]. Quality and effectiveness in the categories of work listed in Article XII, Sections D.1-D.4 are central elements of the Annual Evaluation process [Source 9]. Student evaluation data should not be considered in isolation to make decisions related to the determination of merit raises [Source 9].

However, the University retains sole and exclusive control over academic judgments concerning courses, curriculum, instruction, content of courses, methods of instruction, instructional materials, assignments, class size, and grading policies [Source 1]. Nothing in this clause waives the Union\u2019s right to negotiate mandatory subjects of bargaining [Source 1].\n*   **For Faculty:** The University policy is to maintain and encourage full freedom within the law of inquiry, discourse, teaching, research, and publication [Source 4, 5]. The University aims to protect faculty members against influences that would restrict the exercise of these freedoms in their scholarly research and interest [Source 4, 5]. Faculty members may exercise the same freedoms as other citizens without institutional censorship or discipline, but should be mindful of accuracy, forthrightness, and dignity [Source 4, 5]. A faculty member who believes that they do not enjoy academic freedom is entitled to a hearing on written request before the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure of the campus Senate [Source 4, 5].",

Initial tenure track faculty appointments for more than fifty percent (50%) of full-time service are made by the Board of Trustees upon an advisory vote of the faculty and recommendation of the campus Chancellor/Vice President and President [Source 4]. An assistant professor enters a probationary period not to exceed seven academic years [Source 4].\n\nAt any time except during the last year of the probationary period, an assistant professor on a definite-term appointment may be given written notice of non-reappointment [Source 8]. Except in the case of an assistant professor who is in the first year of academic service at the University, (a) written notice of non-reappointment shall be given not less than twelve months before the expiration of the appointment; or (b) if given less than twelve months before the expiration of the appointment, written notice of non-reappointment shall be accompanied by an offer from the Board of Trustees of a terminal contract for one additional year of academic service [Source 8].\n\nOnly the Board of Trustees may promote or award tenure to tenure track faculty [Source 8].
