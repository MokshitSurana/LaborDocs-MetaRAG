      "answer": "Based on \"[Source 5]\", the appointment level (full time equivalency or FTE) shall be based on the appointing department\u2019s determination of the amount of time it should normally take to perform the assigned duties including orientation and training. It is expected that a .5 FTE assistant will devote an average of 20 hours per week over the course of a full appointment period. Assistants appointed for other FTE levels would be expected to perform work for a proportionately greater or lesser average number of hours per week.",

The agreement also covers employee and union rights [Source 1].\n\nWhile the specifics of the grievance procedure are not detailed in the provided excerpts from the GEO-CBA [Source 1, 2, 3], other faculty agreements provide some general information on grievance procedures:\n\n*   Grievances may be processed by the Union on behalf of an employee, a group of employees, or the Union itself [Source 4, 5, 10].\n*   Either party may have the grievant or a representative present at any step of the grievance procedure [Source 4, 10].\n*   Faculty members can pursue remedies through other mechanisms while retaining union representation [Source 4, 10].\n*   Time limits for filing a grievance exist, and failure to file or appeal within the specified time constitutes a waiver. Time limits can be extended only by mutual written agreement between the University and the Union [Source 4, 5, 10]. For example, one agreement specifies that failure to file a grievance within twenty-five (25) business days after the Union knew or should reasonably have discovered the events on which the grievance is based shall constitute a waiver of the grievance [Source 10].\n*   The University and the Union share the cost for the services of an arbitrator [Source 7].\n*   During the term of the agreement, there shall be no strikes or lockouts [Source 7, 8].\n*   Either party may request the production of specific documents pertinent to the grievance [Source 7, 8].",
