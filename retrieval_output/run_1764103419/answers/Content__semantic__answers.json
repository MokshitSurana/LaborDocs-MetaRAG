      "answer": "The following processes govern non-reappointment or tenure decisions:\n\n*   **Tenure-Track Faculty:** Initial tenure track faculty appointments for more than fifty percent (50%) of full-time service are made by the Board of Trustees upon an advisory vote of the faculty in the relevant academic unit and recommendation of the campus Chancellor/Vice President and President [Source 4, Source 7]. The Board of Trustees is the only body that can promote or award tenure to tenure track faculty [Source 7].\n*   **Non-Reappointment of Assistant Professors:** Assistant professors on a definite-term appointment may be given written notice of non-reappointment, except during the last year of the probationary period [Source 7]. Written notice must be given not less than twelve months before the expiration of the appointment, or a terminal contract for one additional year of academic service must be offered [Source 7]. If the assistant professor is in their first year of academic service, written notice of non-reappointment must be given no later than March 1 and need not be accompanied by an offer of a terminal contract; if given after March 1, it must include a terminal contract [Source 7].\n*   **Non-Reappointment, Dismissal, Layoff, and Recall during Multi-year Contracts (NTT Faculty):** A bargaining unit member with a multi-year appointment may have their appointment terminated during the term of a multi-year appointment if the specific work they have been performing is to be reduced or discontinued and/or the courses for which they were employed to teach are to be reduced or discontinued [Source 6]. The affected faculty member may choose to be placed on a recall list for up to three academic years [Source 6].\n*   **Notice of Non-Reappointment (NTT Faculty):** If the University has not finalized its decision regarding reappointment or non-reappointment, the affected faculty member will be informed by May 15 [Source 6]. Notice of reappointment or non-reappointment shall be provided by July 16 [Source 6]. Bargaining unit members employed as faculty for at least ten years will receive notice of reappointment or non-reappointment one year before the end of their contracts [Source 6].",

This review must be completed within a year of signing the agreement [Source 1]. Individual units can apply for position changes for bargaining unit members to the appropriate Teaching professor rank if the bargaining unit member (1) will perform the job responsibilities of a position bearing the newly adopted \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier, (2) wishes to be considered for the appropriate Teaching professor rank, and (3) possesses the degree required by the University for that rank [Source 1].
