      "answer": "The grievance procedure for assistants covered under the GEO collective bargaining agreement involves multiple levels [Source 3, 9]:\n\n1.  **Informal Resolution:** An effort should first be made to adjust an alleged grievance informally between the assistant (and their Union representative, if so desired) and the immediate supervisor [Source 3]. A request may be made for a time extension to continue efforts towards reaching an informal resolution [Source 3].\n2.  **Level One:**\n    *   The grievant must file a written grievance with the assistant\u2019s Unit Executive Officer (UEO) within thirty (30) business days from the date when the first events or pattern of events on which the grievance is based should reasonably have been discovered [Source 3, 9].\n    *   The written grievance should contain specific information, including a description of the dispute, the facts, the article and section violated, how it was violated, the date(s) of the violation, and the requested remedy [Source 9].\n    *   The UEO or designee will confirm receipt of the grievance within 10 business days and schedule a meeting with the grievant(s) and their Union representative (if so desired) [Source 9].\n    *   Following the meeting, the UEO or designee shall provide a written decision to the grievant and the Union within ten (10) business days [Source 9]. If the parties agree in writing, they may elect not to have a meeting, and the UEO or designee shall give a written decision within ten (10) business days of the decision to not hold a meeting [Source 9].\n3.  **Level Two:**\n    *   If the grievance is not resolved at Level 1, the decision may be appealed to the Dean of the College (or Executive Officer to whom the UEO reports) within ten (10) business days after receipt of the Level 1 decision [Source 9].\n    *   Within 10 business days, the Dean or designee will confirm receipt of the grievance and schedule a meeting with the grievant(s) and their Union representative (if so desired) [Source 9].\n    *   Following the meeting, the UEO or designee shall provide a written decision to the grievant and the Union within ten (10) business days [Source 9]. If the parties agree in writing, they may elect not to have a meeting, and the Dean or designee shall give a written decision within ten (10) business days of the decision to not hold a meeting [Source 9].\n4.  **Level Three:**\n    *   If the grievance is not resolved at Level 2, the decision may be appealed to the Office of the Chancellor or designee in Campus Human Resources within ten (10) business days after receipt of the Level 2 decision [Source 9].\n    *   Within 10 business days, the Chancellor or designee will confirm receipt of the grievance and schedule a meeting with the grievant(s) and their Union representative (if so desired) [Source 9].\n    *   Following the meeting, the Chancellor or designee shall provide a written decision to the grievant and the Union within ten (10) business days [Source 9]. If the parties agree in writing, they may elect not to have a meeting, and the Chancellor or designee shall give a written decision within ten (10) business days of the decision to not hold a meeting [Source 9].\n\nFailure to file a grievance or appeal within the specified time limits constitutes a waiver of the grievance [Source 3]. Written requests for extensions of time limits shall not be unreasonably denied [Source 3]. \"Business days\" are defined as Monday through Friday, excluding campus-designated holidays [Source 3]. The Union has the right to be present at such adjustment [Source 3]. All records of grievances will be kept separate from the official personnel file maintained by the University\u2019s Human Resource Office(s) [Source 3].",

It states that individuals currently in positions modified by \"Clinical\" or \"Research\" modifiers will not be required to convert to the \"Teaching\" modifier as a condition for reappointment [Source 2].\n*   **Efforts to Facilitate Changes and Promotions:** Academic units, unit executive officers, and committees are expected to make every reasonable effort to facilitate appropriate appointment changes and promotions while maintaining the original or current workload, evaluation criteria, and promotion norms for bargaining unit members who do not elect to pursue appointment changes to positions bearing the \"Teaching\" modifier [Source 2].\n*   **Review and Revision of Expectations:** Academic units that adopt the \"Teaching\" modifier for non-tenured academic ranks (assistant professor, associate professor, and professor) must review and revise their written workload expectations, Annual Evaluation criteria, and Promotion Norms and Expectations to distinguish faculty job responsibilities and expectations across all non-tenured academic ranks. This review must be completed within a year of signing the agreement [Source 2].\n*   **Application for Position Changes:** Individual units may elect to apply for position changes for bargaining unit members to the appropriate Teaching professor rank [Source 2]. If a unit determines that a bargaining unit member meets certain criteria (job responsibilities, desire for the rank, and possession of the required degree), the unit will submit a position change request [Source 1].\n*   **Conditions for Appointment Changes:** If a bargaining unit member performs the job responsibilities of a position bearing the \"Teaching\" modifier, wishes to be considered for the appropriate Teaching professor rank, and possesses the degree required by the University for that rank, the unit shall submit a position change request [Source 1].\n*   **Changes in Rank:** Changes in rank shall not affect bargaining unit member salaries and timelines for multi-year contracts. Bargaining unit members who change appointment under this Side Letter shall be considered for promotion under norms established by the candidate\u2019s academic unit [Source 1].\n*   **Hiring in Appropriate Rank:** After academic units complete revisions, units shall hire bargaining unit members in the appropriate rank for the responsibilities the units intend bargaining unit members to perform, and based on the required qualifications for those ranks [Source 1].",
