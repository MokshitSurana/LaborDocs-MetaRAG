      "query": "What FTE range must GEO appointments fall within to be covered by the GEO contract?",
      "answer": "The GEO contract does not specify a particular FTE range that GEO appointments must fall within to be covered by the GEO contract. However, it does state that the appointment level (FTE) shall be based on the appointing department\u2019s determination of the amount of time it should normally take to perform the assigned duties including orientation and training [Source 1]. It also states that it is expected that a .5 FTE assistant will devote an average of 20 hours per week over the course of a full appointment period and that assistants appointed for other FTE levels would be expected to perform work for a proportionately greater or lesser average number of hours per week [Source 1].",

      "answer": "The GEO collective bargaining agreement outlines a grievance procedure for assistants alleging a violation of the agreement by the University [Source 9].\n\nHere's a breakdown of the process:\n\n1.  **Informal Resolution:** An effort should be made to adjust the alleged grievance informally between the assistant (and their Union representative, if desired) and the immediate supervisor [Source 4]. A request can be made for a time extension to continue informal resolution efforts [Source 4].\n2.  **Filing a Grievance:** Failure to file a grievance within thirty (30) business days from when the events occurred that the grievance is based on, will result in a waiver of the grievance [Source 4].\n3.  **Union Representation:** Assistants have the right to Union representation throughout the entire disciplinary process and during any investigatory interviews that may reasonably lead to disciplinary action [Source 9]. The Union must furnish the University with a list of elected officials and officers, including a grievance officer [Source 9].\n4.  **Grievance Procedure:** The specific steps of the grievance procedure are further described in Section E of Article XXII [Source 4]. The Union may file a grievance at Level 3 if the grievance affects more than one assistant, is common to assistants in more than one department, if the supervisor/Unit Executive Officer (UEO) do not have the authority to resolve the grievance, or in a case involving dismissal of an assistant during the appointment period [Source 4].\n5.  **Time Limits:** Failure to appeal a grievance from one level to another within the provided time periods constitutes a waiver of the grievance [Source 4]. Written requests for an extension of time limits shall not be unreasonably denied [Source 4].\n6.  **Protection from Reprisal:** An assistant who participates in the grievance procedure shall not be subject to discipline or reprisal because of such participation [Source 4].\n7.  **Record Keeping:** All records of grievances will be kept separate from the official personnel file maintained by the University\u2019s Human Resource Office(s) [Source 4].",

They also have the right to discipline, suspend, dismiss, and non-renew faculty [Source 1, 2].\n*   **Board of Trustees:** The Board of Trustees makes initial tenure track faculty appointments for more than 50% of full-time service, based on an advisory vote of the faculty in the relevant academic unit and recommendation of the campus Chancellor/Vice President and President [Source 6]. The Board of Trustees is also the only entity that can promote or award tenure to tenure track faculty [Source 3].\n*   **Reappointment Notification:**\n    *   Assistant professors on a definite-term appointment must be given written notice of non-reappointment not less than twelve months before the expiration of the appointment, or be offered a terminal contract for one additional year of academic service [Source 3].

      "answer": "For NTT faculty, here's how promotion and reappointment decisions are handled, according to the provided documents:\n\n*   **Promotion:** Promotion procedures for bargaining unit faculty are determined by the bylaws or policies of the faculty member\u2019s academic unit [Source 6]. Academic units must develop and incorporate procedures for promotion through shared governance within one year of the agreement signing if such procedures are not already included in their bylaws or policies [Source 6]. Bargaining unit members who change appointments to \"Teaching\" professor ranks will be considered for promotion under norms established by their academic unit, following the criteria and guidelines developed by the University Senate and colleges for non-tenured academic ranks using the \"Teaching\" modifier [Source 1].\n*   **Reappointment:** Academic units must develop and incorporate procedures for reappointment of bargaining unit faculty within one year of the signing of the agreement if such procedures are not already included in their bylaws [Source 6]. Faculty members employed continuously for at least ten years receive notice of reappointment or non-reappointment one year before their contracts end [Source 6]. For faculty with less than ten years of continuous employment, the University aims to inform them of reappointment or non-reappointment by May 15 each year [Source 6]. However, if projected student enrollment or funding variables delay the decision, the faculty member will be informed by May 15, with a final decision by July 16 [Source 6].\n*   **University Discretion:** Decisions to reappoint or not reappoint, promote or not promote, and offer or not offer multi-year reappointments are reserved to the sole discretion and judgment of the University and are not subject to the Grievance and Arbitration Article of the Agreement [Source 3].\n*   **Management Rights:** The University retains the right to establish qualifications, appoint, and determine the appointment fractions and duration of employment for all faculty, including whether faculty will be reappointed and the terms governing such reappointment [Source 2, 4].",
