      "answer": "The GEO collective bargaining agreement outlines a grievance procedure for assistants [Source 7]. Key aspects of the process include:\n\n*   **Informal Resolution:** An effort should be made to adjust an alleged grievance informally between the assistant (and their Union representative, if desired) and the immediate supervisor [Source 7]. A request may be made for a time extension to continue efforts towards reaching an informal resolution [Source 7].\n*   **Filing a Grievance:** Failure to file a grievance within thirty (30) business days from the date when the first events or pattern of events on which the grievance is based should reasonably have been discovered, shall constitute a waiver of the grievance [Source 7].\n*   **Waiver:** Failure to appeal a grievance from one level to another within the time periods provided shall constitute a waiver of the grievance [Source 7]. If the University fails to respond to a grievance within the applicable time limit, the grievant may appeal the grievance to the next level [Source 7].\n*   **Time Extension:** Written requests by either party for an extension of any and all time limits as provided in the Article shall not be unreasonably denied [Source 7].\n*   **Protection from Reprisal:** An assistant who participates in the grievance procedure shall not be subject to discipline or reprisal because of such participation [Source 7].\n*   **Union Representation:** The agreement ensures the Union has the opportunity to be present at grievance adjustments [Source 7].\n*   **Grievance Records:** All records of grievances will be kept separate from the official personnel file maintained by the University\u2019s Human Resource Office(s) [Source 7].\n*   **Union Grievances:** The Union may file a grievance at Level 3 if the grievance affects more than one assistant and/or is common to assistants employed in more than one department, or if the grievance is of an issue whereby the supervisor and/or Unit Executive Officer (UEO) do not have authority to resolve the grievance, or in a case involving dismissal of an assistant during the appointment period [Source 7].",

      "answer": "The following outlines the process governing non-reappointment and tenure decisions, based on the provided documents:\n\n**Tenure-Track Faculty:**\n*   **Reappointment:** The Board of Trustees makes tenure track faculty reappointments for more than fifty percent (50%) of full time service upon recommendation of the campus Chancellor/Vice President and the President [Source 1].\n*   **Non-Reappointment Notice:** Assistant professors on a definite-term appointment must be given written notice of non-reappointment. Except for assistant professors in their first year of service, this notice must be given at least twelve months before the appointment expires. If the notice is given less than twelve months before expiration, a terminal contract for one additional year of academic service must be offered by the Board of Trustees. For assistant professors in their first year, notice must be given by March 1, and a terminal contract is not required. If notice is given after March 1, a terminal contract for one additional year of service must be offered [Source 1].\n*   **Non-Reappointment Grievance:** Non-reappointment is not subject to the grievance and arbitration procedure of the agreement [Source 1].\n*   **Promotion and Tenure:** Only the Board of Trustees may promote or award tenure to tenure track faculty [Source 1]. Tenure track faculty attain promotion and tenure in accordance with University of Illinois Statutes, The General Rules Concerning University Organization and related UIC campus policies [Source 1].\n*   **Disputes:** Disputes related to appointment, reappointment, promotion and tenure shall be handled under the University of Illinois Statutes and The General Rules Concerning University Organization and are not subject to the Grievance and Arbitration process [Source 8].\n\n**Bargaining Unit Faculty (Non-Tenure Track):**\n*   **Reappointment Notification:** Faculty members who have not been continuously employed as faculty for at least ten years will be informed of their reappointment or non-reappointment by May 15 each year [Source 2]. Bargaining unit members who have been continuously employed as faculty for at least ten years will receive notice of reappointment or non-reappointment one year before the end of their contracts [Source 2].\n*   **Termination During Multi-Year Contracts:** A bargaining unit member with a multi-year appointment may have their appointment terminated during the term if the specific work they have been performing or the courses they were employed to teach are reduced or discontinued [Source 2]. The affected faculty member may choose to be placed on a recall list for up to three academic years [Source 2].\n*   **Dismissal During Multi-Year Contracts:** Other than discontinuance of a program, a bargaining unit member can only be dismissed during the term of a multi-year contract for cause, as described in the University of Illinois Statutes and UIC policy (FPPG 804) [Source 5].\n*   **Reappointment and Promotion Decisions:** Decisions by the University to reappoint or not reappoint, to promote or not promote, and/or to offer or not offer a multi-year reappointment to a faculty member are reserved to the sole discretion and judgment of the University and are not subject to the Grievance and Arbitration Article of the Agreement [Source 5].\n\n**University's Rights:**\n*   The University retains the right to determine whether faculty will be reappointed, including the terms and conditions governing such reappointment [Source 3, 4].\n*   The University retains the right to discipline, suspend, dismiss, non-renew, and reappoint faculty [Source 3, 4].",

The Provost, VCHA, or a designee from their office, along with a representative from Labor and Employee Relations, shall meet to hear the grievance. Within fourteen (14) business days after the meeting, a written decision will be issued [Source 9].\n*   **Level 4:** If unresolved in Level 3, the decision can be appealed to arbitration [Source 9].\n\nThe arbitration process includes:\n\n1.  **Request:** The Union may submit a grievance to arbitration, provided written notice of intent to arbitrate is delivered to the Office of Labor Relations within twenty-five (25) business days following receipt of the decision in Level 3 [Source 9].\n2.  **Selection of Arbitrator:** The parties attempt to agree upon an arbitrator within fourteen (14) business days after the request to arbitrate. If they cannot agree, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services (FMCS) will be jointly requested to submit a panel of five (5) arbitrators who are members of the National Academy of Arbitrators. Each party can reject one panel in its entirety and request a new panel. Both the University and the Union have the right to strike two (2) names from the panel, with the order decided by a coin flip or equivalent random selection process. The remaining person will be the arbitrator [Source 9].\n3.  **Hearing:** A single arbitrator will hear the grievance, and both parties may be represented by persons they designate. Both parties have the right to a hearing to submit evidence, offer testimony, and make oral or written arguments [Source 9].\n4.  **Decision:** The arbitrator must issue a written decision within twenty-five (25) business days from the date of the close of the hearings or from the date the final statements and proofs on the issues are submitted. The arbitrator's decision must include findings of fact, reasoning, and conclusions on the issues submitted. The arbitrator's authority is limited to determining whether the University has violated arbitrable provisions of the contract [Source 9].\n\nThe arbitrator\u2019s authority is limited to determining whether the University has violated arbitrable provisions of the contract [Source 3]. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding on the University and Union, subject to the provisions of the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Act [Source 3]. The cost for the services of the arbitrator, including per diem expenses, if any, and actual and necessary travel and subsistence expenses shall be borne equally by the University and the Union [Source 3].",
