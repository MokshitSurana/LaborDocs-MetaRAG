      "answer": "The grievance procedure for graduate employees under the GEO collective bargaining agreement involves multiple levels of review [Source 8].\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n*   **Filing Deadline:** A grievance must be filed within thirty (30) business days from when the events or pattern of events on which the grievance is based should reasonably have been discovered [Source 3].\n*   **Informal Resolution:** Informally attempting to resolve the matter does not preclude filing a written grievance [Source 3].\n*   **Union Representation:** The Union can process grievances on behalf of an employee, a group of employees, or itself [Source 2]. Either party may have the grievant or one grievant representing a group of grievants present at any step of the grievance procedure [Source 2].\n*   **Protection Against Reprisal:** Assistants who participate in the grievance procedure shall not be subject to discipline or reprisal because of such participation [Source 3].\n*   **Record Keeping:** All records of grievances will be kept separate from the official personnel file [Source 3].\n*   **Level 3 Filing:** The Union may file a grievance at Level 3 if the grievance affects more than one assistant, is common to assistants in more than one department, if the supervisor/Unit Executive Officer (UEO) do not have authority to resolve it, or in cases involving dismissal during the appointment period [Source 3].\n\nThe grievance procedure involves three levels [Source 3]:\n\n*   **Level One:** If the Union and Employer agree in writing, they may elect not to have a meeting, and the UEO or designee shall give a written decision on the grievance to the grievant and the Union within ten (10) business days of the decision to not hold a meeting [Source 8].\n*   **Level Two:** If not resolved at Level 1, the decision can be appealed to the Dean of the College within ten (10) business days after receipt of the Level 1 decision. The Dean or designee will confirm receipt and schedule a meeting. Following the meeting, a written decision will be provided within ten (10) business days. If the Union and Employer agree in writing, they may elect not to have a meeting, and the Dean or designee shall give a written decision on the grievance to the grievant and the Union within ten (10) business days of the decision to not hold a meeting [Source 8].\n*   **Level Three:** If not resolved at Level 2, the decision may be appealed to the Office of the Chancellor or designee in Campus Human Resources within ten (10) business days after receipt of the Level 2 decision. The Chancellor or designee will confirm receipt and schedule a meeting. Following the Level 3 grievance meeting, the Chancellor or designee shall give a written decision on the grievance to the grievant and the Union within ten (10) business days of the meeting. If the Union and Employer agree in writing, they may elect not to have a meeting, and the Chancellor or designee shall give a written decision on the grievance to the grievant and the Union within ten (10) business days of the decision to not hold a meeting [Source 8].",

Any procedural dispute under this Article under the control of a Party to this Agreement shall be resolved under the Grievance and Arbitration procedure in this Agreement, and any such grievance decision thereunder shall be limited to providing a remedy correcting a process error [Source 8].\n\nThe standard grievance procedure involves several steps, including informal discussion, filing a written grievance with the immediate supervisor, and potential appeals to higher levels [Source 4]. Faculty members may have Union representation while pursuing a remedy through the campus grievance procedure [Source 4, 9].
