      "query": "What is the process for resolving grievances under the GEO collective bargaining agreement?",
      "answer": "The grievance procedure under the provided collective bargaining agreements varies depending on the employee group. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**NTT Faculty:**\n\n*   **Definition:** A grievance is defined as a complaint filed by an employee, a group of employees, or the Union alleging that the University breached a section of the agreement [Source 10].\n*   **Representation:** Every faculty member covered by the agreement, with or without Union representation, may pursue a grievance [Source 10].\n*   **Time Limits:** Failure to file a grievance within twenty-five (25) business days after the Union knew or should reasonably have discovered the events on which the grievance is based constitutes a waiver of the grievance [Source 6]. Failure to appeal a grievance from one level to another within the provided time periods also constitutes a waiver [Source 6].\n*   **Extensions:** Written requests by either Party for an extension of any and all time limits shall not be unreasonably denied [Source 6].\n*   **Informal Discussions:** Day-to-day problems may be discussed between faculty and supervisors; such informal discussions are encouraged but shall have no effect upon the time limits set forth in the Agreement [Source 10].\n*   **Union Role:** Grievances may be processed by the Union on behalf of an employee, a group of employees, or on behalf of itself [Source 6]. The Union must furnish the University with a list of elected officials and officers, including a grievance officer, by September 15 of each academic year and inform the University of any changes [Source 10].\n*   **Other Remedies:** The grievance procedure does not preclude faculty members from pursuing a remedy through existing statutory or administrative mechanisms, or existing campus grievance procedures. Faculty members may have Union representation while pursuing a remedy through the campus grievance procedure [Source 6].\n*   **Resolution:** Substantive disputes are resolved under Article X, Section 2(d) of the University of Illinois Statutes [Source 1]. Procedural disputes are resolved under the Grievance and Arbitration procedure in the Agreement, with any grievance decision limited to correcting a process error [Source 1].\n\n**Residents:**\n\n*   **Informal Step:** Residents are strongly encouraged to discuss the matter with their designated supervisor in an effort to settle the problem informally [Source 7]. Such informal discussions shall have no effect upon the time limits set forth in the Agreement [Source 7].\n*   **Step One:** A resident who alleges a breach of a specific term of the Agreement has twenty-eight (28) calendar days to file a grievance from the date of the occurrence or when the resident/Union should have reasonably known of it, whichever is earlier [Source 3, 7]. The grievance must be in writing, signed, and filed with the resident\u2019s department, including the date of violation, a description of the dispute, the facts, the sections of the Agreement violated, and the relief sought [Source 3]. The department will provide a written decision within twenty-eight (28) calendar days after receipt of the grievance or after a meeting if held [Source 3].\n*   **Step Two:** If not resolved at Step 1, the decision may be appealed in writing to the designated representative of the College of Medicine within fourteen (14) calendar days after the Step 1 decision is received or due [Source 3]. The Chancellor (or designee) will offer a hearing, conduct an investigation, and issue a written decision within twenty-eight (28) calendar days after the hearing of the appeal [Source 3].\n*   **Step Three:** If not resolved at Step 2, the decision may be appealed in writing to the University of Illinois \u2013 System Level grievance hearing officer within fourteen (14) calendar days after the Step 2 decision is received or due [Source 3].\n*   **Representation:** Each resident has the right to Union representation at grievance meetings and arbitration hearings [Source 7].\n*   **Discrimination/Harassment:** If a grievance contains allegations of discrimination or harassment, the University may refer the grievance to the campus Office of Access and Equity or other designated office [Source 7].\n*   **Time Limits:** Failure to file or appeal a grievance within the specified time periods constitutes a waiver of the grievance and the appeal process [Source 7]. If the University fails to respond within the applicable time periods, the grievant may appeal to the next step within fourteen (14) calendar days after the final date the University\u2019s response was due [Source 7].",

Disputes related to these decisions are handled under these statutes and rules, and are not subject to the Grievance and Arbitration Article XVIII of the agreement [Source 1].\n\nFor bargaining unit faculty, reappointment procedures are provided in the bylaws of the faculty member\u2019s academic unit [Source 2].
