Assistants\u2019 hours of work are reflected in their percentage of appointment. Such hours\nof work are separate and distinct from the time required for an assistant\u2019s own academic\ncoursework. The appointment level (full time equivalency or FTE) shall be based on the\nappointing department\u2019s determination of the amount of time it should normally take to\nperform the assigned duties including orientation and training. It is expected that a .5 FTE\nassistant will devote an average of 20 hours per week over the course of a full\nappointment period. Assistants appointed for other FTE levels would be expected to\nperform work for a proportionately greater or lesser average number of hours per week.\nThe actual number of weekly hours of work are expected to vary over the course of the\nappointment term.\nB. It is understood that assistants in the bargaining unit are engaged in professional\nactivities of such a nature that the output produced, or the result accomplished, cannot be\nprecisely standardized or measured in relation to a given period of time, and that the time\nnecessary to accomplish an assignment may vary.\nC. An assistant may object to a workload that causes their hours of work to exceed the\nhours expected for the FTE of their appointment, as provided above, if the assistant\nreasonably believes that their duties require hours that exceed the hours of effort required\nby the appointment percentage or constitute an arbitrary or capricious workload. The\nassistant must raise the matter with their department supervisor. Following the meeting\nwith the assistant, if the department supervisor concludes that the assistant is working\nexcessive hours based on their assigned FTE, the supervisor shall recommend: (1) that\nthe assistant conform to the hours normally needed by assistants with similar duties; (2)\nthat certain duties be reduced and/or reassigned to others; (3) that the assistant\u2019s FTE be\nincreased; or (4) that the assistant be reassigned with consultation to a different position\nwith equivalent appointment terms. Should the appropriate department supervisor fail to\nresolve the issue of excessive hours of work to the mutual satisfaction of both parties, the\nassistant shall have the option of pursuing the matter through the Grievance Procedure in\naccordance with Article XXII of this Agreement.\nD. Employment and course assignments shall be offered to the assistant in a timely\nfashion and as quickly as practically possible, to allow for adequate preparation. If course\nassignments offered in writing are subsequently changed, the hours spent in preparation\nfor the original assignment shall be credited for the purpose of determining workload.\nWhen there is a pattern of late assignment changes in a department less than five (5)\nbusiness days before the start of classes, a meeting shall be held for purposes of\naddressing the reason. These meetings shall include the Department Head or designee\nand a representative from the Union. Course assignments shall not be made in a\ncapricious manner.\n13",

It is the policy of the University to maintain and encourage full freedom within the law of\ninquiry, discourse, teaching, research, and publication and to protect any member of the\nbargaining unit against influences, from within or without the University, which would restrict\nthe member\u2019s exercise of these freedoms in the member\u2019s area of scholarly research and\ninterest.\nB. As a citizen, a faculty member may exercise the same freedoms as other citizens without\ninstitutional censorship or discipline. A faculty member should be mindful, however, that\naccuracy, forthrightness, and dignity befit association with the University and a person of\nlearning, and that the public may judge that person\u2019s profession and the University by the\nindividual\u2019s conduct and utterances.\nC. A faculty member who believes that they do not enjoy the academic freedom which is the\npolicy of the University to maintain and encourage shall be entitled to a hearing on\nwritten request before the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure of the campus\nSenate. Such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with established rules of\nprocedure. The Committee shall make findings of facts and recommendations to the\nPresident and, at its discretion, may make an appropriate report to the Senate. The several\ncommittees may from time to time establish their own rules of procedure.\nD. Any substantive dispute under this Article shall be resolved under Article X, Section 2\n(d), of the University of Illinois Statutes.\nE. Any procedural dispute under this Article under the control of a Party to this Agreement\nshall be resolved under the Grievance and Arbitration procedure in this Agreement, and\nany such grievance decision thereunder shall be limited to providing a remedy correcting a\nprocess error.\nArticle XI.

The Parties to this\nAgreement recognize and support the role of the UIC Senate as established by the University\nof Illinois Statutes such as its general responsibilities in areas including but not limited to: (a)\ncurriculum policy and curricular structure; (b) requirements for degrees and granting of\ndegrees; (c) policies for recruitment, admission and retention of students; (d) academic policies\nrelating to students; (e) reviewing and proposing changes to the Statutes; and (f) academic\nfreedom. The above list of Senate responsibilities is not inclusive of the Senate\u2019s full role as\nprovided in the University of Illinois Statutes and is not intended to expand or limit that role.\nB.

In that event, the affected faculty member will\nbe informed by May 15 that the University has not been able to finalize its decision\nregarding their reappointment or non-reappointment. In the latter event, notice of the\nfaculty member\u2019s reappointment or non-reappointment shall be provided by July 16.\n3. Bargaining unit members who have been continuously employed as faculty for at least\nten years will receive notice of reappointment or non-reappointment one year before\nthe end of their contracts.\nC. Promotion\nProcedures for promotion of bargaining unit faculty within the ranks identified in the\nUniversity of Illinois Statutes (as such Statutes may be amended from time to time) shall be\nas provided in the bylaws or policies of the bargaining unit member\u2019s academic unit. If\nsuch procedures are not included in their bylaws or policies, academic units shall develop\nand incorporate into their bylaws or policies procedures for promotion of bargaining unit\nmembers through shared governance within one year of the signing of this agreement.\nD. Non-reappointment, Dismissal, Layoff, and Recall during Multi-year Contracts\n1. A bargaining unit member with a multi-year appointment under this Article IX may have\ntheir appointment terminated during the term of a multi-year appointment if the specific\nwork they have been performing is to be reduced or discontinued and/or the courses for\nwhich they were employed to teach are to be reduced or discontinued. The affected\nfaculty member may choose to be placed on a recall list for up to three academic years.\na. In the event the reduced or discontinued specific work and/or courses are\nreinstated, the faculty member on the recall list shall be offered reinstatement to\ncomplete the remaining term of their multi-year appointment. Gaps in service\ndue to termination and reinstatement under this Article IX, D.1 shall not be\ncounted as disrupting consecutive years of service for the purpose of promotion\nor movement toward multi-year contracts.\n19 of 35",

The University will not negotiate terms and\nconditions of employment regarding residents, as defined by law, without their Union\nrepresentative present. This procedure, if followed in good faith by both parties, should\nlead to a fair and prompt solution to most of the University/resident problems.\nStep One\nRegardless of whether a grievable matter is sought to be resolved through informal\ndiscussion, a resident who alleges the University has breached a specific term of this\nAgreement shall have twenty-eight (28) calendar days to file a grievance, calculated\nfrom the date of the occurrence leading to the grievance or twenty-eight (28) calendar\ndays after the resident or Union should reasonably have known of the occurrence\nleading to the grievance, whichever is earlier. To be considered, a grievance must\nallege a breach of a specific term of this Agreement, be in written form, signed by the\nresident(s) or representative and filed with the resident\u2019s department.\nThe written grievance must contain: the date of the violation, a specific description of\nthe dispute, the facts of the case, the section(s) of the Agreement alleged to have been\nviolated, and the relief sought. The department will give a written decision on the\ngrievance within twenty-eight (28) calendar days after receipt of the grievance or within\ntwenty-eight (28) calendar days of a meeting, if the department chooses to hold one,\nwhichever is later.\nStep Two\nIn the event the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the decision may be appealed in\nwriting to the designated representative of the College of Medicine. The appeal must be\nfiled within fourteen (14) calendar days after the Step 1 decision is received or due,\nwhichever occurs first. Any decision at Step 1 that is not appealed within fourteen (14)\ncalendar days after it is received or due shall be considered binding and is not\nappealable. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Chancellor (or designee) will offer a hearing\nto the grievant, conduct any investigation that is deemed necessary, and issue a written\ndecision on the grievance within twenty-eight (28) calendar days after hearing of the\nappeal.\n19",
