No Strike or Lockout\nThis Agreement contains a grievance resolution procedure which provides for final and binding\narbitration of disputes concerning the interpretation of this Agreement. Therefore, during the\nterm of this Agreement, there shall be no strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns or sympathy\nstrikes. No officer or representative of the Union shall authorize, institute, instigate, aid or\ncondone any such activities by members of the bargaining unit. The Union further agrees that it\nwill take reasonable means which are within its power to induce employees engaged in a strike\nor work stoppage in violation of the terms of this Agreement to return to work; such reasonable\nmeans include the Union, through its officials, disavowing in writing any such action or\ninterference and advising in writing that faculty engaged in such activity immediately return to\nwork and cease the violation. Faculty who violate this Article may be subject to disciplinary\naction under the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of this \u201cno strike pledge\u201d, no lockout\nof employees shall be instituted by the Employer during the term of this Agreement; provided,\nhowever, this Article should not be construed as requiring the University to stay in continuous\noperation.\nArticle XX.

If either Party makes a request, the\ninvalidated part(s) or provision(s) will be renegotiated.\nArticle XXII. Entire Agreement\nThe Parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each\nhad the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any\nsubject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and that the\nunderstandings and agreements arrived at by the Parties after the exercise of that right and\nopportunity are set forth in this Agreement.\nThis Agreement represents the entire agreement between the University and the Union, and no\nfurther decisional bargaining is required during the term of the Agreement over mandatory or\npermissive subjects or practices not expressly addressed in this Agreement.
