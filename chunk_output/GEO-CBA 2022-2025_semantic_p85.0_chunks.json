The\nassistant must raise the matter with their department supervisor. Following the meeting\nwith the assistant, if the department supervisor concludes that the assistant is working\nexcessive hours based on their assigned FTE, the supervisor shall recommend: (1) that\nthe assistant conform to the hours normally needed by assistants with similar duties; (2)\nthat certain duties be reduced and/or reassigned to others; (3) that the assistant\u2019s FTE be\nincreased; or (4) that the assistant be reassigned with consultation to a different position\nwith equivalent appointment terms. Should the appropriate department supervisor fail to\nresolve the issue of excessive hours of work to the mutual satisfaction of both parties, the\nassistant shall have the option of pursuing the matter through the Grievance Procedure in\naccordance with Article XXII of this Agreement. D. Employment and course assignments shall be offered to the assistant in a timely\nfashion and as quickly as practically possible, to allow for adequate preparation. If course\nassignments offered in writing are subsequently changed, the hours spent in preparation\nfor the original assignment shall be credited for the purpose of determining workload. When there is a pattern of late assignment changes in a department less than five (5)\nbusiness days before the start of classes, a meeting shall be held for purposes of\naddressing the reason. These meetings shall include the Department Head or designee\nand a representative from the Union.",
