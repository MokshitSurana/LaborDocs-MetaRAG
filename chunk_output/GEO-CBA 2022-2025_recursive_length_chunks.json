If an offer of appointment is conditional upon the assistant\nbeing certified by the University as being proficient in English oral communication, that\ncondition must be stated in writing in the original offer. If a unit fails to stipulate this\ncondition in writing in the offer of appointment and the assistant attempts but fails to\nmeet the University\u2019s certification requirements, then provided the assistant meets all\nother conditions of the offer, the unit must appoint the assistant to a non-instructional\nassistantship of the same term and compensation as the original offer. Assistants not\ncertified by the University as proficient in English communication and those with\nconditional certification are required to complete a University-approved training program\nbefore retaking any certification tests.

The appointment level (full time equivalency or FTE) shall be based on the\nappointing department\u2019s determination of the amount of time it should normally take to\nperform the assigned duties including orientation and training. It is expected that a .5 FTE\nassistant will devote an average of 20 hours per week over the course of a full\nappointment period. Assistants appointed for other FTE levels would be expected to\nperform work for a proportionately greater or lesser average number of hours per week.\nThe actual number of weekly hours of work are expected to vary over the course of the\nappointment term.\nB.

An assistant may object to a workload that causes their hours of work to exceed the\nhours expected for the FTE of their appointment, as provided above, if the assistant\nreasonably believes that their duties require hours that exceed the hours of effort required\nby the appointment percentage or constitute an arbitrary or capricious workload. The\nassistant must raise the matter with their department supervisor. Following the meeting\nwith the assistant, if the department supervisor concludes that the assistant is working\nexcessive hours based on their assigned FTE, the supervisor shall recommend: (1) that\nthe assistant conform to the hours normally needed by assistants with similar duties; (2)\nthat certain duties be reduced and/or reassigned to others; (3) that the assistant\u2019s FTE be\nincreased; or (4) that the assistant be reassigned with consultation to a different position\nwith equivalent appointment terms. Should the appropriate department supervisor fail to\nresolve the issue of excessive hours of work to the mutual satisfaction of both parties, the\nassistant shall have the option of pursuing the matter through the Grievance Procedure in\naccordance with Article XXII of this Agreement.\nD. Employment and course assignments shall be offered to the assistant in a timely\nfashion and as quickly as practically possible, to allow for adequate preparation. If course\nassignments offered in writing are subsequently changed, the hours spent in preparation\nfor the original assignment shall be credited for the purpose of determining workload.\nWhen there is a pattern of late assignment changes in a department less than five (5)\nbusiness days before the start of classes, a meeting shall be held for purposes of\naddressing the reason. These meetings shall include the Department Head or designee\nand a representative from the Union. Course assignments shall not be made in a\ncapricious manner.\n13",

A copy of the note that this informal\ndiscussion was held will be provided to the assistant and will not be included in the\nassistant\u2019s personnel file.\nB. Positive progressive discipline may occur in the following manner:\n1. If the supervisor\u2019s attempt to correct the assistant\u2019s deficiencies through an\ninformal discussion is unsuccessful, the first step in the progressive disciplinary\nprocess shall be a pre-disciplinary meeting. The assistant shall be notified at least\ntwo (2) days in advance in writing of the purpose of the meeting and the possible\nimposition of discipline. At the pre-disciplinary meeting, the assistant shall be\ngiven the opportunity to rebut the alleged deficiencies.\n2. After the pre-disciplinary meeting, the supervisor will issue in writing the\noutcome of the pre-disciplinary meeting. If discipline is issued, disciplinary action\nmay include but is not limited to: a written reprimand, reduction of appointment\nduties, reassignment, or suspension of appointment. The document will be placed\nin the assistant\u2019s personnel file. The assistant shall be given the opportunity to\nsubmit a written statement refuting the reason for discipline that shall be included\nin the file in accordance with HR Policy 1301. A written disciplinary action that is\none (1) or more years old shall not be used for the purpose of pyramiding\npenalties for like offenses.\nDiscipline shall be issued in a confidential manner so as not to cause\nembarrassment to the assistant.\nC.
