The University will not require Residents to make up time unless\nrequired by ACGME, or the certifying board. 11.08 Family and Medical Leave (FML)\nPursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), or any applicable state\nleave laws, an eligible Resident will be granted up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave\nin a 12-month period. 11.09 Bereavement Leave\nA Resident shall receive (5) paid days for bereavement purposes in the event\nof the death of the Resident\u2019s immediate family members per University\npolicies and rules, as they may be amended from time to time, and applicable\nstate law. 11.10 Sick Leave\nResidents shall accrue sick leave with compensation at the rate of twenty-four\n(24) days per academic year.",

If the\nUniversity fails to respond to a grievance within the applicable time periods specified\nbelow, the grievant may appeal the grievance to the next step of the grievance process\nwithin fourteen (14) calendar days if the University fails to answer the grievance on the\nfinal date on which the University\u2019s response was due. 16.03 Grievance Procedure\n18\n\nInformal Step\nA resident who alleges the University has breached a term of this Agreement is strongly\nencouraged to discuss the matter with the resident\u2019s designated supervisor in an effort\nto settle the problem informally. Such informal discussions shall have no effect upon the\ntime limits set forth in this Agreement. The University will not negotiate terms and\nconditions of employment regarding residents, as defined by law, without their Union\nrepresentative present. This procedure, if followed in good faith by both parties, should\nlead to a fair and prompt solution to most of the University/resident problems. Step One\nRegardless of whether a grievable matter is sought to be resolved through informal\ndiscussion, a resident who alleges the University has breached a specific term of this\nAgreement shall have twenty-eight (28) calendar days to file a grievance, calculated\nfrom the date of the occurrence leading to the grievance or twenty-eight (28) calendar\ndays after the resident or Union should reasonably have known of the occurrence\nleading to the grievance, whichever is earlier. To be considered, a grievance must\nallege a breach of a specific term of this Agreement, be in written form, signed by the\nresident(s) or representative and filed with the resident\u2019s department. The written grievance must contain: the date of the violation, a specific description of\nthe dispute, the facts of the case, the section(s) of the Agreement alleged to have been\nviolated, and the relief sought.",
