The\nParties acknowledge that discipline might not be progressive if the offense is sufficiently\nserious. 26 of 35\n\nC. The levels of progressive discipline for bargaining unit members are: (1) verbal counseling, (2)\nletter of warning, (3) suspension, and (4) dismissal. D. In cases of disciplinary verbal counseling the unit head must inform the bargaining unit\nmember that they are receiving a verbal counseling and must provide the reasons for the\nverbal counseling. E. A unit head shall convene a pre-disciplinary meeting if discipline other than a verbal\ncounseling is contemplated, and notify the bargaining unit member in writing of the purpose of\nthe meeting at least two (2) days in advance of the meeting. The bargaining unit member shall\nbe given the opportunity at or before the meeting to rebut the reasons for the contemplated\ndiscipline. F. Bargaining unit members have the right to Union representation throughout the disciplinary\nprocess, including during any investigatory interview that may reasonably lead to discipline. G. Except for purposes of determining a pattern of behavior, letters of warning will remain\nin effect for purposes of progressive discipline for only two full consecutive semesters. H. Situations in which a faculty member is placed on paid leave pending the conclusion of an\ninvestigation shall not be considered discipline.",

Academic units that elect to adopt the \u201cTeaching\u201d modifier for non-tenured academic ranks of\nassistant professor, associate professor, and professor shall review and revise their written\nworkload expectations, Annual Evaluation criteria, and Promotion Norms and Expectations to\ndistinguish faculty job responsibilities and expectations as necessary across all non- tenured\nacademic ranks used in these units.
