No\nofficer or representative of the Union shall authorize, institute, instigate, aid or condone any such\nactivities by members of the bargaining unit.

Faculty who violate this Article may be subject to disciplinary action under the terms\nof this Agreement. In consideration of this \u201cno strike pledge\u201d, no lockout of employees shall be\ninstituted by the Employer during the term of this Agreement; provided, however, this Article\nshould not be construed as requiring the University to stay in continuous operation. 28 of 30\n\nArticle XX.",
