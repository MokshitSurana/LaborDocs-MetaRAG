This Agreement is intended to establish\nand make clear the wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment of bargaining unit\nemployees and to provide a procedure for the equitable resolution of grievances as required by\nterms of the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Act.\nArticle II. Recognition\nPursuant to the Order of Certification issued by the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board on\nJune 28, 2012, in case number 2012-RC-0008-C, the Corrected Order of Certification issued by\nthe Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board on July 22, 2022, in case number 2022-RS- 0013-\nC, and subsequent IELRA regulation amendments, the University recognizes UIC United Faculty\nLocal 6456, IFT-AFT, AAUP, AFL-CIO (herein referred to as the \"Union\"), as the exclusive\nrepresentative for the purpose of collective bargaining for the bargaining unit described below\nand such other classifications as may be added in accordance with the law:\nIncluded: All full-time (i.e., employees who have 0.51 or greater appointment as a faculty\nmember) non-tenure track faculty, and all Bridge to Faculty program scholars.\nExcluded: All faculty members of the College of Pharmacy, the College of Medicine, the\nSchool of Law, and the College of Dentistry and all Bridge to Faculty program scholars in\nthose colleges and all supervisors, managerial and confidential employees as defined under\nthe Illinois Educational Labor Relations Act.\nArticle III.

Neither the University nor the Union intend that any of the terms of this\nAgreement abridge or diminish the roles of the faculty or the University as established in\nUniversity Statutes, as amended by the Board of Trustees from time to time. References in\nthis Article to traditional areas of management rights in the work place do not supplant the\nprovisions of University Statutes that, among other things, provide for the roles of the\nfaculty and the other administrative and organizational entities that comprise the University.\nB. Except as specifically abridged by this Agreement, all powers, rights, and authority of the\nUniversity are reserved by the University, and the University retains sole and exclusive\ncontrol over any and all matters in the operation, management, and administration of the\nUniversity; the control of its properties and the maintenance of order and efficiency of\nthe workforce; and complete authority to exercise those rights and powers by making and\n1 of 35",

As a citizen, a faculty member may exercise the same freedoms as other citizens without\ninstitutional censorship or discipline. A faculty member should be mindful, however, that\naccuracy, forthrightness, and dignity befit association with the University and a person of\nlearning, and that the public may judge that person\u2019s profession and the University by the\nindividual\u2019s conduct and utterances.\nC. A faculty member who believes that they do not enjoy the academic freedom which is the\npolicy of the University to maintain and encourage shall be entitled to a hearing on\nwritten request before the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure of the campus\nSenate. Such hearing shall be conducted in accordance with established rules of\nprocedure. The Committee shall make findings of facts and recommendations to the\nPresident and, at its discretion, may make an appropriate report to the Senate.

Any procedural dispute under this Article under the control of a Party to this Agreement\nshall be resolved under the Grievance and Arbitration procedure in this Agreement, and\nany such grievance decision thereunder shall be limited to providing a remedy correcting a\nprocess error.\nArticle XI.

The Parties to this\nAgreement recognize and support the role of the UIC Senate as established by the University\nof Illinois Statutes such as its general responsibilities in areas including but not limited to: (a)\ncurriculum policy and curricular structure; (b) requirements for degrees and granting of\ndegrees; (c) policies for recruitment, admission and retention of students; (d) academic policies\nrelating to students; (e) reviewing and proposing changes to the Statutes; and (f) academic\nfreedom.

No officer or representative of the Union shall authorize, institute, instigate, aid or\ncondone any such activities by members of the bargaining unit. The Union further agrees that it\nwill take reasonable means which are within its power to induce employees engaged in a strike\nor work stoppage in violation of the terms of this Agreement to return to work; such reasonable\nmeans include the Union, through its officials, disavowing in writing any such action or\ninterference and advising in writing that faculty engaged in such activity immediately return to\nwork and cease the violation. Faculty who violate this Article may be subject to disciplinary\naction under the terms of this Agreement. In consideration of this \u201cno strike pledge\u201d, no lockout\nof employees shall be instituted by the Employer during the term of this Agreement; provided,\nhowever, this Article should not be construed as requiring the University to stay in continuous\noperation.\nArticle XX. Electronic Availability of Agreement\nWithin thirty (30) days of ratification, the University shall post this Agreement to its website. The\nUniversity shall maintain this Agreement on its website for the duration of the Agreement.\nArticle XXI. Savings Clause\nShould any part of this Agreement or any provision(s) contained herein be determined to be\nillegal or invalid by a court or agency of competent jurisdiction or if compliance with or\nenforcement of any provision should be restrained by a court or agency pending a final\ndetermination as to its validity, such part or provision(s) shall not invalidate the remaining\nportions hereof, and they shall remain in full force and effect. If either Party makes a request, the\ninvalidated part(s) or provision(s) will be renegotiated.\nArticle XXII. Entire Agreement\nThe Parties acknowledge that during the negotiations which resulted in this Agreement, each\nhad the unlimited right and opportunity to make demands and proposals with respect to any\nsubject or matter not removed by law from the area of collective bargaining, and that the\nunderstandings and agreements arrived at by the Parties after the exercise of that right and\nopportunity are set forth in this Agreement.\nThis Agreement represents the entire agreement between the University and the Union, and no\nfurther decisional bargaining is required during the term of the Agreement over mandatory or\npermissive subjects or practices not expressly addressed in this Agreement.
