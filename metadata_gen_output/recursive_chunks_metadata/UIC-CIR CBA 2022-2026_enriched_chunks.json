Such informal discussions shall have no effect upon the\ntime limits set forth in this Agreement. The University will not negotiate terms and\nconditions of employment regarding residents, as defined by law, without their Union\nrepresentative present. This procedure, if followed in good faith by both parties, should\nlead to a fair and prompt solution to most of the University/resident problems.\nStep One\nRegardless of whether a grievable matter is sought to be resolved through informal\ndiscussion, a resident who alleges the University has breached a specific term of this\nAgreement shall have twenty-eight (28) calendar days to file a grievance, calculated\nfrom the date of the occurrence leading to the grievance or twenty-eight (28) calendar\ndays after the resident or Union should reasonably have known of the occurrence\nleading to the grievance, whichever is earlier. To be considered, a grievance must\nallege a breach of a specific term of this Agreement, be in written form, signed by the\nresident(s) or representative and filed with the resident\u2019s department.\nThe written grievance must contain: the date of the violation, a specific description of\nthe dispute, the facts of the case, the section(s) of the Agreement alleged to have been\nviolated, and the relief sought. The department will give a written decision on the\ngrievance within twenty-eight (28) calendar days after receipt of the grievance or within\ntwenty-eight (28) calendar days of a meeting, if the department chooses to hold one,\nwhichever is later.\nStep Two\nIn the event the grievance is not resolved at Step 1, the decision may be appealed in\nwriting to the designated representative of the College of Medicine. The appeal must be\nfiled within fourteen (14) calendar days after the Step 1 decision is received or due,\nwhichever occurs first. Any decision at Step 1 that is not appealed within fourteen (14)\ncalendar days after it is received or due shall be considered binding and is not\nappealable. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Chancellor (or designee) will offer a hearing\nto the grievant, conduct any investigation that is deemed necessary, and issue a written\ndecision on the grievance within twenty-eight (28) calendar days after hearing of the\nappeal.\n19",
