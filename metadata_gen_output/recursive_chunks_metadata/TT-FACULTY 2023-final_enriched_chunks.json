There shall be no discrimination against any employee because of Union membership or\nbecause the employee is acting as a representative of the Union or its members or other\nemployees pursuant to the Agreement or policies or rules.\nC. The University of Illinois and the Union will not tolerate harassment. Harassment is defined\nas unwelcome conduct that is based on the actual or perceived categories above in Section A\nthat has the purpose or effect of: 1) becoming a condition of continued employment; or 2) is\nsufficiently severe or pervasive to substantially interfere with the individual's work\nperformance or create what a reasonable person would consider an intimidating, hostile, or\noffensive work environment.

Sexual\nharassment and sexual misconduct are defined in the University\u2019s Comprehensive Policy\nand Procedures for Sexual Misconduct Grievance Process. The University\u2019s policy can be\nfound on the Office for Access and Equity (OAE) website. The University considers such\nbehavior, whether physical or verbal, to be a breach of its standards of conduct.\nE. The University of Illinois and the Union do not condone workplace bullying. In the event that\nthe UI System adopts a definition of and policy governing bullying, the University will\nfollow the policy governing bullying.

The University will take action to provide remedies when such unlawful discrimination\nand/or harassment is properly reported or discovered as provided by law, and University\npolicy. The University considers the behavior laid out in Sections A-E to be a breach of its\nstandards of conduct.

The University will acknowledge receipt of new written and signed dues deduction\nauthorization cards within seventeen (17) days of their physical receipt by University\nPayroll and Benefits (UPB).\n3. The University will process written and signed dues deduction authorization cards\nsubmitted for bargaining unit employees as soon as reasonably practicable after their\nreceipt by the UPB office. To provide sufficient time for UPB to process dues\ndeduction authorization cards, such cards must be submitted at least seven (7)\nbusiness days prior to the calculation processing date, i.e., the date on which UPB\nbegins the payroll calculation process for University employees who are being paid\non a monthly basis.\n4. The University will send payment to the Union for the total amount deducted with a\nlist identifying the amount deducted from each individual electing to have this\ndeduction made from their paycheck, the type of deduction, and the amount\ndeducted within ten (10) working days of the deduction being made.\n5. In the event the Union becomes aware that an employee no longer in the bargaining\nunit has had dues withheld, the Union will send written notification (email is\npreferred) to the University asking that the employee be refunded. The written\nnotification will include the employee\u2019s name, UIN and the dollar amount to refund.\nThe University will complete a payroll adjustment within 30 days of receipt of the\nnotification and refund the employee. The University will then reduce the remission\nof dues withholding owed to the Union by the same amount of the refund on a\nsubsequent payment of dues withholding to the Union.\n6. Nothing contained herein shall require the University to take action to collect dues\nfrom any employee in any given pay period except to the extent that such\nemployee earns wages from the University in that period.\n7. The University shall take such steps as may be required to accomplish any wage\nwithholding authorized or required by Section G and shall do such things as are\nnecessary to cause said withholding to be remitted to the Union within thirty (30)\ncalendar days after the date of withholding, provided that nothing contained in this\nArticle shall require the University to make any withholding unless and until the\nUnion has notified the University of the address to which the amount so withheld\n15 of 30",

Evaluation\n1. The University reaffirms the objective of its Annual Evaluation of Faculty at UIC\nPolicy (FPPG 700), as affirmed by the UIC Senate and which currently states that \u201cthe\nperformance of all faculty at UIC with at least fifty percent (50%) appointments shall be\nevaluated annually through a formal procedure that is open and equitable.

Student evaluation data shall not be considered in isolation to make decisions related to\nthe renewal of employment, promotion cases, or the determination of merit raises.\nE. Procedures for Reduction in Force, Proposed Discontinuance of Programs or Departments\nIn the event of discontinuance of admission to a program or department, the University will treat\nthe discontinuance as it would the elimination of a program or department.\nArticle X.

As a citizen, a faculty member may exercise the same freedoms as other citizens without\ninstitutional censorship or discipline. A faculty member should be mindful, however, that\naccuracy, forthrightness, and dignity befit association with the University and a person of\nlearning, and that the public may judge that person\u2019s profession and the University by the\nindividual\u2019s conduct and utterances.\nC. A faculty member who believes that they do not enjoy the academic freedom which is the\npolicy of the University to maintain and encourage shall be entitled to a hearing on written\nrequest before the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure of the campus Senate.\nSuch hearing shall be conducted in accordance with established rules of procedure.

Faculty who violate this Article may be subject to disciplinary action under the terms\nof this Agreement. In consideration of this \u201cno strike pledge\u201d, no lockout of employees shall be\ninstituted by the Employer during the term of this Agreement; provided, however, this Article\nshould not be construed as requiring the University to stay in continuous operation.\n28 of 30",
